# Genetic Algorithm Robots

A C++ project that uses genetic algorithms to evolve robot behaviors.

## Overview

This project implements a genetic algorithm in C++ to optimize robotic behaviors. It includes a straightforward genetic algorithm workflow (selection, crossover, mutation, evaluation) and a `Makefile` to compile and run.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GNU Make
- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)

### Build & Run

```bash
make          # Build the project
./main        # Run the compiled executable
